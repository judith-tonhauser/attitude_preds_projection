# if too much of the variance in at-issueness is explained by the prior 
# so that collinearity is too high: 
# regress prior onto ai and enter residuals as new predictor

# if none of the block effects reach significance, re-run analysis without block predictor 
# for ease of interpretability

# if random effects structure prevents model from converging, 
# remove slopes step-wise, starting with block interactions and main effect
